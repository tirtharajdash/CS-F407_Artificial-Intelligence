## Welcome to the AI course (CS F407) | Spring 2026

| Instructors               | [Ashwin Srinivasan](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin-srinivasan/), [Tirtharaj Dash](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/tirtharaj-dash) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The course handout can be found [here](https://github.com/tirtharajdash/CS-F407_Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/handouts). The course lectures will be interleaved between "Good Old Fashioned AI" (GOFAI) and "New Fashioned AI" (NewFAI). GOFAI lectures will be taken by AS (mostly), and NewFAI lectures will be taken by TD (mostly). The official course portal will be Moodle: [click here](https://quantaaws.bits-goa.ac.in/course/view.php?id=3980). This GitHub repository is a secondary source for almost everything about the course and can be used by students who are not officially registered.

### Course Project

You can find the course project problem statement [here](https://github.com/tirtharajdash/CS-F407_Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/project/prob.md). The project weighs $20%$ of your course total and may be a bonus weight. So work on it well. And, the deadline is around the first week of April, 2026. So, do get started asap.

### Reading materials

Textbooks: Some are below that we like. You are free to read other books.

 - Russell and Norvig: Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (any edition will work) [book](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)
 - Huyen: AI Engineering [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/)
 - Raschka: Build LLM from Scratch [book](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch)

Some relevant tutorials we (TD and AS) developed with our TAs back in the early 2020s. They still work, surprisingly, and are still very useful.
You can use this link ([BITS F464 Lab and Tutorial link](https://bits-f464.github.io/)) to access for lab and tutorial on Python and tutorials on Probability models and Bayesian Networks, etc.

*If you can't get a book, it is okay to just go over the GitHub repositories or any other materials that you can find associated with these books. The AIMA book is readily available everywhere (1st-3rd editions).*
